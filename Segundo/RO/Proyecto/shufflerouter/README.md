A testbed for the practicals of the Redes de Ordenadores subject

## Overview

This is a simple echo server that redirects received UDP packets after a
random amount of time —so packets can get reordered or even dropped—.

Received packets **must** carry the destination address in the first four
bytes of the payload and the destination port as the fifth and sixth byte. All
of them in *network byte order*. Packets are forwarded with the first six
bytes replaced by the sender's IP address and port.
